<h1>Comparison of C/POSIX standard library implementations for Linux</h1>

<p>A project of <a href="http://www.etalabs.net/">Eta Labs</a>.

</p><p>The table below and notes which follow are a comparison of some of
the different standard library implementations available for Linux,
with a particular focus on the balance between feature-richness and
bloat. I have tried to be fair and objective, but as I am the author
of <b><a href="http://www.musl-libc.org/">musl</a></b>, that may have
influenced my choice of which aspects to compare.

</p><p>Future directions for this comparison include detailed performance
benchmarking and inclusion of additional library implementations,
especially Google's Bionic and other BSD libc ports.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<h3>In general</h3>

<p>For each comparison in the table, each library is marked in red,
yellow, or green. Red or yellow indicates that the library fails to
support a feature or satisfy an optimality condition that may be
desirable to <i>some users</i>.

</p><p>For comparisons involving testing and measurement, the particular
library versions compared are:

</p><ul>
<li>musl 1.1.5
</li><li>uClibc 0.9.33.2 (Buildroot 2015.02)
</li><li>dietlibc 0.32
</li><li>glibc 2.19
</li></ul>

<p>Note that previous versions of this comparison included eglibc
rather than glibc, mainly since Debian-based distributions were using
the eglibc fork during the time in which glibc was essentially
unmaintained. Since most of eglibc has been merged back into glibc and
eglibc is being discontinued, the comparison has been updated based on
glibc.


</p><h3>Bloat comparison</h3>

<p>Roughly speaking, “bloat” is used to refer to overhead cost that
does not contribute to the functioning of an application.

</p><p>All figures are approximate based on the tests of versions of these
libraries available on systems I use. I've used <tt>size(1)</tt>
instead of file size since static library files are roughly 80% ELF
header overhead for the contained object files. Part of what makes the
shared libraries larger than their static equivalents is that they
include parts of libgcc for long division and other math functions.

</p><p>The size totals for glibc include the size of iconv modules,
roughly 5M, in the “Complete .so set” figure. These are essential to
providing certain functionality, and should be installed whether
static or dynamic linking is being used.

</p><p>The smallest C program is:</p>

<pre>int main() {}</pre>

<p>And the "hello" program I used is:</p>

<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(int argc, char **argv) { printf("hello %d\n", argc); }</pre>

<p>I've written it this way to ensure that the compiler cannot
optimize the string printed to a constant and replace the call
to <tt>printf</tt> with a call to <tt>puts</tt>.

</p><p>Overhead is measured in dirty pages, i.e. the amount of swap-backed
physical memory each process requires. These are a mix of private
copy-on-write maps of the program image on disk, the heap, the stack,
and anonymous maps. The <tt>/proc/$pid/smaps</tt> file was used to
obtain the numbers for a program spinning in an infinite loop.

</p><p>Dynamic linking overhead is largely dependent on the dynamic
linker. A good 12-16k of the dynamic overhead is due to inefficiency
in the standard dynamic linker. Ideally, replacing it could drop the
overhead difference between static- and dynamic-linked programs to a
single page.

</p><p>It should be noted that uClibc was tested with many optional
features enabled, particularly locale. Due to a bug (design flaw) in
uClibc's locale support, locale loading code and <tt>malloc</tt> get
linked even in programs which never use <tt>setlocale</tt>.

</p><h3>Behavior on resource exhaustion</h3>

<p>These comparions deal with the robstness of various interfaces when
the amount of free memory or other system resources are extremely low.
Reporting failure is shaded green when it is the theoretical optimal
behavior; it is shaded yellow when an alternate implementation could
successfully perform the operation with no resource usage.

</p><p>Thread-local storage covers both the case of attempting to create a
new thread when there is insufficient memory available to satisfy the
thread-local storage requirements of all loaded modules, and the case
of attempting to load a new module with thread-local storage
via <tt>dlopen</tt> when there is insufficient memory available to
satisfy the storage requirements of all extant threads.

</p><p>In the case of <tt>pthread_cancel</tt>, NPTL dynamically
loads <tt>libgcc_s.so.1</tt> at runtime upon the first cancellation
request, and aborts the program if loading fails for any reason,
including but not limited to resource exhaustion.



</p><h3>Performance comparison</h3>

<p>All of these figures were obtained using
my <a href="http://www.etalabs.net/libc-bench.html"><tt>libc-bench</tt></a> suite, in UTF-8
locales, on one particular Intel Atom N280-based machine. They are not
intended to be rigorous, only to give a rough idea of relative
order-of-magnitude performance.

</p><p>The tiny and big allocation figures are
from <tt>b_malloc_tiny1</tt> and <tt>b_malloc_big1</tt>. The
allocation contention tests measure malloc performance when two
threads are simultaneously performing allocation and free operations.
In the first test (local), each thread frees its own allocations. In
the second (shared), the allocating and freeing thread are often not
the same, breaking thread-local arena/cache optimizations.

</p><p>The strstr figure is the max time taken by any of the strstr tests,
in the interest of measuring worst-case time; which case is worst
varies by implementation. glibc's bad performance could be fixed
trivially by removing the code that disables the best optimization for
needles shorter than 32 bytes; with this change it should match or
slightly outperform musl.

</p><p>The thread create and join figure is
from <tt>b_pthread_createjoin_serial1</tt>.

</p><h3>ABI and versioning comparison</h3>

<p>Backwards compatibility means the usual thing, that new versions of
the library are compatible with programs compiled against an older
version. "Forwards compatibility" is a term I may have invented, but
the idea it's intended to convey is that old versions of the library
are compatible with programs compiled against a newer version, as long
as the program does not depend on features that were missing from the
older library version. In the latter case, the program would simply
fail at (static or dynamic) link time with missing symbols.

</p><p>Perhaps the simplest way to think of "forwards compatibility" is
that it means you're not required to upgrade the library unless a
program actually needs functionality that's missing in your version.

</p><p>Symbol versioning and forwards compatibility both have merits, but
they're essentially mutually exclusive.

</p><p>"Atomic upgrades" means that a single atomic filesystem operation
upgrades the library, with no race condition window during which
dynamic-linked programs might fail to run. The canonical way to ensure
atomic upgrades is having the whole library in a single <tt>.so</tt>
file.

</p><h3>Algorithms comparison</h3>

<p>When comparing substring search algorithms, <i>m</i> typically
refers to the length of the needle (substring) and <i>n</i> typically
refers to the length of the haystack (string to be searched). The
two-way algorithm is <i>O(n)</i>, and with the Boyer-Moore-like
improvements musl uses (and which glibc uses, but only for extremely
long needles), typical runtime is proportional to <i>n/m</i>. The
naive algorithm is <i>O(nm)</i>.

</p><p>Backtracking regular expression implementations are simple to
write, but have pathologically bad performance on many simile
real-world expressions, and fail to take advantage of the regularity
of the language.

</p><p>The naive quicksort dietlibc uses has <i>O(n)</i> space requirement
on the stack, meaning it can and will lead to stack-overflow crashes
in real-world usage. This can be fixed by choosing the optimal order
of recursion and performing tail-call optimizations. Quicksort is
also <i>O(n²)</i> in time, and while typical performance is much
better, worst-case performance is very bad. Shell sort is
typically <i>O(n<sup>α</sup>)</i> where 1&lt;<i>α</i>&lt;2, though it
can be optimized to <i>O(n(log n)²)</i>. Determining the
characteristics of uClibc's version would require some analysis.
Smooth sort is <i>O(n log n)</i> and interpolates smoothly down
to <i>O(n)</i> proportional roughly to the degree to which the input
is already sorted. Intro sort is a variant of quicksort which detects
worst-case recursion and switches to heap sort to maintain <i>O(n log
n)</i> bounds.

</p><h3>Features comparison</h3>

<p>Exact floating point printing refers to the ability to print the
exact value of floating point numbers with <tt>printf</tt> when the
specified precision is high enough. For instance, as a
double-precision value, <tt>0.1</tt> is
0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625, which is
the diadic rational 115292150460684704/2<sup>60</sup>. Perhaps more
usefully, the (exactly representable) number 2<sup>-60</sup> should
print as
0.000000000000000000867361737988403547205962240695953369140625 rather
than some inexact approximation.

</p><p>A complete C99 math library consists of the new single-precision
and extended-precision versions of all the previously existing math
functions, as well as their complex versions and <tt>tgmath.h</tt>.

</p><p>POSIX threads refers to threads with real POSIX semantics, not the
historical broken LinuxThreads (where each thread behaves like a
distinct process) or similar implementations.

</p><p>POSIX localedef refers to the ability to define custom locales,
including charsets, etc.

</p><p><a href="http://www.openwall.com/tcb/">TCB passwords</a> are a
feature from <a href="http://www.openwall.com/">Openwall</a> which
move the password hashes from <tt>/etc/shadow</tt>
to <tt>/etc/tcb/<i>username</i>/shadow</tt>. This allows users to
change passwords and allows programs running as the user (for example,
screen lockers) to authenticate the user's password without special
suid or sgid privileges.

</p><p>Linux extensions refer to kernel interfaces provided by Linux
outside the scope of POSIX and historical behavior
- <tt>epoll</tt>, <tt>signalfd</tt>, extended attributes,
capabilities, module loading, and so on.

</p><h3>Target architectures comparison</h3>

<p>There are a number of conformance issues in glibc's x32 support,
the most notable being that it defines the <tt>tv_nsec</tt> member
of <tt>struct timespec</tt> as <tt>long long</tt> despite both POSIX
and C11 requiring it to have type <tt>long</tt>. This discrepency
affects use with formatted printing functions and use of pointers to
the member, among other things. A number of other interfaces also have
been changed to use <tt>long long</tt> instead of <tt>long</tt> in
structures; in many cases there is no standard governing the affected
interface, but the changes break the interface contract published in
other documentation such a Linux man pages.

</p><p>uClibc's microblaze port is marked partial because it lacks support
for threads and possibly other core features.

</p><p>Ports marked "experimental" are those documented as such; this may
mean some functionality is broken and/or ABI is not stable.

</p><h3>Build environment comparison</h3>

<p>"Legacy-code-friendly headers" means that the system C header files
evolved out of historical practice, and by default define/declare many
things they shouldn't but which some legacy code might expect. They
typically rely on deep levels of nested inclusion and complex
conditional compilation.

</p><p>"Lightweight headers" are roughly the opposite, written from
scratch to match the C and POSIX standards, with minimal nested
inclusion and preprocessor conditionals. This leads to an enormous
performance advantage compiling large numbers of small files, but it
also means poorly-written programs that relied on certain
implementation-specific legacy characteristics might need minor fixes
to compile.

</p><p>Some of the libraries reviewed are virtually impossible to use
without having built GNU binutils and gcc specifically targetting them
(i.e. a native toolchain). Others make it easy to use an existing
toolchain originally targetting a different library, overriding
certain compiler and linker options to use the alternate library
implementation.

</p><p>Respect for the C and POSIX namespaces means that the namespace
used by the standard C and standard POSIX functions and headers
conforms to what these standards say about which names are reserved
for the implementation versus reserved for the application. One common
area of non-conformance is remapping functions
like <tt>open</tt>, <tt>lseek</tt>, etc.
to <tt>open64</tt>, <tt>lseek64</tt>, etc. - names which are reserved
for the application. This is flagged as "LFS64 problems" in the table.

</p><h3>Security/hardening comparison</h3>

<p>"Attention to corner cases" means that the library follows a
general philosophy of being careful to support all possible inputs
that don't explicitly invoke <i>undefined behavior</i>, especially
when the input may come from a source external to the program.
Over-use of <tt>malloc</tt> is flagged in the comparison when some
interfaces that should not have any failure cases have created
artificial ones due to the possibility of memory exhaustion.

</p><p>An unsafe UTF-8 decoder is one which fails to detect invalid
sequences and happens to decode them as aliases for valid characters.

</p><p>Heap corruption detection means <tt>malloc</tt> makes an effort to
detect, report, and abort when it detects double-free, attempts to
free a pointer not obtained via <tt>malloc</tt>, etc.

</p><h3>Misc. comparisons</h3>

<p>The choice of license affects the usability of a standard library
implementation. GPL v2-only is shaded as the "worst" choice, in that
it is incompatible with a large volume of Open Source/Free Software,
namely anything using GPL v3-only. LGPL v2.1-only is much less
problematic; it does not allow creation of a new LGPL-licensed library
by merging with LGPL v3-only code, but it allows the merged program to
be released under version 3 or later of the GPL. LGPL v2.1-or-later is
very flexible, and MIT or BSD even moreso.
